            <h3>Solar Energy</h3>
            <div id="p1"><p>Solar energy involves the utilization of sunlight to generate electricity through photovoltaic (PV) cells.These cells, commonly found in solar panels, convert sunlight directly into electrical energy through the photovoltaic effect. Solar power ? is abundant, environmentally friendly, and can be harnessed using various technologies such as solar photovoltaic systems, solar thermal systems, and concentrated solar power. Solar energy plays a crucial role in the transition to cleaner energy sources, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels.</p></div>

            <h3>Wind Energy</h3>
            <div id="p2"><p>Wind energy is a form of solar energy that results from the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the sun. As sunlight heats the Earth, different regions absorb solar energy at varying rates, leading to temperature differentials. These temperature variations cause air movement, creating wind. Wind energy is harnessed through wind turbines, which capture the kinetic energy of the wind and convert it into mechanical power. This mechanical power is then transformed into electricity through a generator. Wind power is a sustainable and renewable energy source with the potential to contribute significantly to global electricity generation.</p>
